Project Description: This project is to test the running time of three algorithms solving the largest sub-matrix sum problem of different time complexity of O(n^6),O(n^4) and O(n^3). The total project consists of one .c file.


Running Instruction

Input:

n	// size of the  random matrix to generate

m	// which algorithm to test: 1 stand for O(n^6) 2 stand for O(n^4) 3 stand for O(n^3)
	
k	// the iteration times of the algorithm


output:

Ticks	//to see whether ticks>=10  achieving the required accuracy

Total time		//the total time the algorithm consumed for running k times



Sample Input:

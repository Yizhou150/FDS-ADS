If you want to try the test programs follow the following steps:
1.use “notepad(记事本)” to open the input.in and input two integers NUMBER_OF_NODES and TEST_TIMES, each stands for the nodes of the tree to generate and the number of test cases.
Sample：
100 1000
//we will generate a tree with 100 nodes and test for 1000 times
2. Compile and run the compare_win.c
over

The compare_win.c will compile and run the other three programs. GenerateTree.c will output its data into the test.in. The test.in consist of two parts, the input data and the answer, then testfile.c read test.in and output its result into test1.out , answer.c will read the test.in and directly output the correct answer into test2.out. The compare_win.c will compare the test1.out and test2.out and give the result. If you want to see the input and output data, you can just open the test.in test1.out test2.out 

If you can't compile the test program, just run the executable file compare_win.exe.

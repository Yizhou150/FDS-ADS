If you want to try the test programs follow the following steps:
1.use “notepad(记事本)” to open the input.in and input two integers NUMBER_OF_NODES and ITERATIONS, each stands for the nodes of the tree to generate and the iterations to test the algorithm.
Sample：
5 100000
//we will generate a tree with 5 nodes and test the algorithm for 100000 iterations to output the total time.
2. Compile and run the TestTime.c
over

The TestTime.c will compile and run the other two programs. GenerateTree.c will output its data into the test.in. The test.in includes the required input data, then testfile.c read test.in and output the total time consumption.

If you can't compile the test program, just run the executable file TestTime.exe.

The "For_Judge" program is used to pass the test on PTA.
The "For_Human" program has instructions and hints for user to test.

The c. file is our source code and the exe. is the executive file .To build the executable file,you just need to compile it and run in your ide, this c. file can perfectly work in windows,or you can just try the exe.
Because we use scanf to input,you are supposed to input your tree by yourself, of course you can build a text and use files to save your time,but you might have to change the code by yourself, 
Meanwhile our test codes are available.
Thanks!

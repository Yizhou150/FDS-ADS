The c. file is our source code and the exe. is the executive file .To build the executable file,you just need to compile it and run in your ide, this c. file can perfectly work in windows,or you can just try the exe. The gmon.out is an extra file to assure the executable file to operate well.
For the ForPTAJudge.c program, it has passed the PTA judge and you can put it on PTA to test its correctness. For the ForHuman.c program, you can run the program and follow the instructions to input data and see the result.
Meanwhile our test codes are available.
Thanks!
